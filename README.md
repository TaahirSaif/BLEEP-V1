## Overview

BLEEP is designed as a modular, scalable, and intelligent blockchain platform. Its features include:

- **Self-Amending Core**: Enables protocol upgrades without hard forks.
- **AI Decision Engine**: Integrated AI for smart resource allocation and governance enhancements.
- **Quantum and ZK-Ready VM**: Ensures long-term security and privacy.
- **WASM-Based Contracts**: Secure, efficient smart contract execution.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Easily integrates with other blockchain ecosystems.
- **Super App Ecosystem**: Designed to host blockchain tools, developer resources, communication layers, and more.

---

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **BLEEP VM**: Manages WASM smart contract execution, gas metering, and resource isolation.
- **AI Engine**: Located in `core/ai_decision`, this module supports machine learning-driven decision logic.
- **PAT Module**: Supports programmable assets using the BLP token.
- **BLEEP Connect**: Enables cross-chain interaction and distribution.
- **Configuration Files**: Define genesis parameters and network types (testnet/mainnet).

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- `wasm-pack`
- Git

### Building the Node

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BleepEcosystem/BLEEP-V1.git
cd BLEEP-V1
cargo build --release
```

### Running a Local Node

```bash
cargo run -- --config config/testnet_config.json
```

> For mainnet, switch to `config/mainnet_config.json`.

---

## Configuration

- `config/genesis.json`: Initial blockchain state
- `config/testnet_config.json`: Test network settings
- `config/mainnet_config.json`: Production environment

Update these as needed for custom deployments or forks.

---

## BLEEP Token (BLP)

- **Symbol**: `BLP`
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: 200,000,000
- **Governance**: Hybrid structure (on-chain + council)
- **Tokenomics**: Supports programmable asset fuel, staking, governance, and faucet use.

---

## Programmable Asset Token (PAT)

PATs are smart asset representations in the BLEEP ecosystem. They are:

- Modular
- Governed using BLP
- Interoperable across chains and apps
- Designed for both on-chain and off-chain asset representation

---

## Faucet & Wallet

BLEEP includes a combined wallet + faucet system with:

- Wallet creation and import
- AI-based management features
- Multi-chain integration
- Cross-chain distribution via **BLEEP Connect**
- WASM contract support

---

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Node deployment and configuration
- [x] BLP token model finalized
- [x] AI module architecture defined
- [ ] PAT module implementation
- [ ] Faucet + Wallet integration
- [ ] Cross-chain support with BLEEP Connect
- [ ] AI/Quantum/ZK upgrades to BLEEP VM
- [ ] Super App ecosystem front-end

---

## 🔧 Testnet Status

BLEEP is currently in internal testnet mode with multiple validator nodes under simulation.  
A public testnet (with explorer, faucet, and developer tools) will launch in **Q4 2025**.

---

## 💖 Support BLEEP

BLEEP is self-funded and fully open-source. Your support accelerates core development, ecosystem growth, and infrastructure audits.
