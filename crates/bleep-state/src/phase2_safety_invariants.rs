// PHASE 2: DYNAMIC SHARDING UPGRADE
// SAFETY INVARIANTS AND GUARANTEES
//
// This document formalizes the safety properties of the Phase 2 adaptive sharding system.
// All claims are enforced by code and verified by tests.

//! # PHASE 2 SAFETY INVARIANTS
//!
//! ## 1. DETERMINISTIC SHARD TOPOLOGY
//!
//! **Invariant**: Shard topology for an epoch is fully deterministic.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: All honest nodes independently compute identical shard layout
//! for any given epoch, given identical validator sets and protocol parameters.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ShardTopologyBuilder` produces topology deterministically
//! - `EpochShardTopology` locks topology per epoch
//! - Topology changes occur at epoch boundaries only
//! - All nodes compute same `shard_registry_root` for same epoch
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_deterministic_shard_topology_computation`
//! - All topology derivation uses only on-chain metrics and epoch ID
//! - No local state or randomness influences topology
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Network partition: Each partition independently computes same topology
//! - Byzantine validator: Cannot force alternative topology (consensus enforces)
//! - Out-of-order block reception: Height → epoch → topology is deterministic
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 2. EPOCH-BOUND TOPOLOGY (NO MID-EPOCH CHANGES)
//!
//! **Invariant**: Shard topology cannot change mid-epoch.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: Once an epoch starts, shard layout is immutable for its duration.
//! Topology changes apply atomically at epoch transitions.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `EpochShardBinder::stage_topology_change()` requires next epoch
//! - `EpochShardBinder::commit_epoch_transition()` applies changes atomically
//! - Blocks carry `shard_registry_root` (must match current epoch)
//! - Mid-epoch block with wrong registry root is rejected
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_epoch_boundary_topology_transitions`
//! - Test: `test_block_validation_rejects_shard_topology_mismatches`
//! - Code: `EpochShardBinder` enforces strict epoch advancement
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Byzantine validator proposing mid-epoch topology change: Rejected by validation
//! - Network partition with different epoch clocks: Impossible (height determines epoch)
//! - Consensus disagreement on topology: Prevented by deterministic computation
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 3. FORK SAFETY (TOPOLOGY DISAGREEMENT IMPOSSIBLE)
//!
//! **Invariant**: Honest nodes cannot fork due to shard topology disagreement.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: Blocks with incorrect shard configuration are unconditionally rejected.
//! A fork would require an honest node to accept an invalid block.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - Block header includes:
//!   * `epoch_id` (deterministically computed from height)
//!   * `shard_registry_root` (canonical commitment to shard layout)
//!   * `shard_id` (shard this block is assigned to)
//!   * `shard_state_root` (commitment to shard state)
//! - `EpochShardBinder::verify_block_shard_fields()` rejects all blocks with:
//!   * `shard_registry_root ≠ expected_root_for_epoch`
//!   * `shard_id ∉ active_shards`
//!   * Inconsistent epoch in block header
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_shard_registry_root_fork_prevention`
//! - Test: `test_block_validation_rejects_shard_topology_mismatches`
//! - Code: All block validation includes topology checks
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Byzantine validator sending topology-mismatch block: Rejected by consensus
//! - Network partition creating topology fork: Impossible (deterministic)
//! - Light client with stale topology: Protected by height-based epoch calculation
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 4. SHARD SPLIT PRESERVES STATE AND TRANSACTIONS
//!
//! **Invariant**: Shard splits preserve all state and pending transactions.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: No state loss, no transaction loss, no reordering during split.
//! State is divided according to deterministic keyspace partitioning.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ShardLifecycleManager::plan_shard_split()` uses deterministic keyspace midpoint
//! - `ShardSplitOp::verify_partition()` ensures no keyspace gaps or overlaps
//! - Split occurs at epoch boundary only
//! - Transactions are routed to correct child based on keyspace membership
//! - State root is preserved and committed
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_shard_split_preserves_keyspace_and_state`
//! - Code: `Shard::contains_key()` routes transactions deterministically
//! - Code: State migration uses Merkle roots
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Validator dropping transactions during split: Detected at state root mismatch
//! - Byzantine split creating overlapping shards: Prevented by `verify_partition()`
//! - State corruption during split: Detected by Merkle root verification
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 5. SHARD MERGE MAINTAINS STATE INTEGRITY
//!
//! **Invariant**: Shard merges maintain state integrity and transaction ordering.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: Merged shards preserve all state and transaction history.
//! Only adjacent shards with contiguous keyspaces can merge.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ShardLifecycleManager::plan_shard_merge()` verifies adjacency
//! - `ShardMergeOp::verify_coverage()` ensures complete keyspace coverage
//! - Transaction queues are concatenated in order
//! - State roots are merged deterministically
//! - Committed transaction count is preserved
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_shard_merge_combines_state_safely`
//! - Code: Keyspace adjacency check prevents inconsistent merges
//! - Code: Transaction queue concatenation preserves order
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Byzantine merge of non-adjacent shards: Prevented by adjacency check
//! - State loss during merge: Detected by state root verification
//! - Transaction reordering: Prevented by queue concatenation logic
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 6. DETERMINISTIC VALIDATOR ASSIGNMENT
//!
//! **Invariant**: Validator assignments to shards are fully deterministic.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: All honest nodes independently compute identical validator sets
//! for each shard, given the same global validator set and epoch.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ShardValidatorAssigner` implements multiple strategies (all deterministic):
//!   * `UniformDistribution`: Round-robin assignment
//!   * `StakeWeighted`: Proportional to stake
//!   * `DeterministicHash`: SHA3-256 based selection
//! - No randomness; outputs depend only on validator set and shard ID
//! - Validator rotation at proposer position is deterministic
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_validator_assignment_is_deterministic`
//! - Same inputs always produce same outputs across nodes
//! - Each shard gets > 0 validators (enforced)
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Byzantine validator claiming different assignment: Own node computes same
//! - Network partition with different validators: Handled by validator set finality
//! - Proposer misbehavior: Slashing evidence recorded at shard level
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 7. BYZANTINE FAULT TOLERANCE PER SHARD
//!
//! **Invariant**: Each shard can tolerate up to f Byzantine validators where f = (n-1)/3.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: If <= f validators per shard are Byzantine, shard consensus is safe.
//! The global validator set must have >= 3f+1 validators.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ValidatorSet::is_valid()` enforces minimum 4 validators
//! - `ValidatorSet::max_byzantine_faults()` computes BFT threshold
//! - Each shard has >= 1 validator (enforced)
//! - Slashing removes Byzantine validators from future epochs
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_byzantine_fault_tolerance_per_shard`
//! - Code: Validator assignment ensures all shards are covered
//! - Code: Invalid validator sets are rejected at genesis
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - f >= n/3 Byzantine validators globally: Chain safety degraded (expected)
//! - f Byzantine validators in single shard: Cannot reach consensus (BFT guarantee)
//! - Shard validator set imbalance: Checked during assignment
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 8. SHARD STATE ROOT VERIFIABILITY
//!
//! **Invariant**: Shard state roots are cryptographic commitments to shard state.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: Light clients can verify shard state by checking Merkle roots.
//! State transitions are atomic and verifiable.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ShardStateRoot` contains:
//!   * `root_hash`: SHA3-256 Merkle root
//!   * `tx_count`: Transaction count
//!   * `height`: Committed at which height
//! - `Shard::commit_transactions()` atomically updates state root
//! - Block includes `shard_state_root` for verification
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_shard_state_root_verification`
//! - Test: `test_registry_root_includes_all_shard_state`
//! - Code: State root computed using Merkle tree
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Forged state root: Detected by Merkle verification
//! - Partial state update: Detected by state root mismatch
//! - Replay of old state root: Blocked by height-based ordering
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 9. REGISTRY ROOT AS CANONICAL COMMITMENT
//!
//! **Invariant**: `shard_registry_root` is the canonical commitment to all shard state.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: The registry root in a block header is a cryptographic hash of:
//! - All active shard IDs
//! - All shard state roots
//! - All validator assignments
//!
//! The root changes when any shard's state changes.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `ShardRegistry::recompute_registry_root()` hashes all shards
//! - Block validation requires `shard_registry_root == expected_root`
//! - Light clients can verify entire shard state from registry root
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_registry_root_includes_all_shard_state`
//! - Code: Registry root computed deterministically
//! - Code: Any shard update changes registry root
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Stale registry root: Rejected by block validation
//! - Inconsistent shard state: Detected by root mismatch
//! - Light client fork: Prevented by height-based epoch derivation
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 10. AI ADVISORY IS NON-AUTHORITATIVE
//!
//! **Invariant**: AI reports are advisory only; they never override protocol rules.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: Even if all AI systems are compromised, they cannot:
//! - Trigger automatic shard splits
//! - Trigger automatic shard merges
//! - Change consensus mode
//! - Alter validator assignments
//! - Cause forks
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `AiAdvisoryReport` is signed but not verified by consensus
//! - `BoundedScore` limits all AI outputs to [0, 100]
//! - `AiAdvisoryAggregator` uses median (robust to outliers)
//! - Split/merge decisions use ONLY on-chain metrics, never AI inputs
//! - AI callbacks are optional; system works with no AI
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_ai_advisory_is_bounded_and_non_authoritative`
//! - Test: `test_ai_report_aggregation_is_robust`
//! - Code: No AI callback in critical path of consensus
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - All AI nodes report "split now": Ignored by protocol
//! - Malicious AI signing fake reports: Verification fails, reports ignored
//! - AI-triggered consensus change: Impossible (AI has no authority)
//! - Byzantine AI causing fork: Impossible (protocol is deterministic)
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 11. DETERMINISTIC KEYSPACE ROUTING
//!
//! **Invariant**: Transactions are routed to shards deterministically by key.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: The same transaction always routes to the same shard.
//! All honest nodes route transactions identically.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - `Shard::contains_key()` checks [keyspace_start, keyspace_end)
//! - Keyspace division is determined at topology creation
//! - Keyspace is immutable within an epoch
//! - Splits and merges preserve keyspace coverage
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_shard_keyspace_containment`
//! - Test: `test_shard_split_preserves_keyspace_and_state`
//! - Code: No random keyspace assignment
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Byzantine node routing transaction to wrong shard: Invalid block format
//! - Transaction crossing keyspace boundary: Detected during split
//! - Overlapping keyspaces: Prevented by split logic
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## 12. CONSENSUS ENFORCEMENT OF TOPOLOGY
//!
//! **Invariant**: Consensus layer enforces shard topology invariants.
//!
//! **Guarantee**: PBFT and PoS consensus reject blocks that violate topology rules.
//! Topology changes are mediated through consensus, not autonomous.
//!
//! **Implementation**:
//! - Block validation includes topology checks
//! - Consensus engines verify `shard_registry_root`
//! - Topology changes are proposed as blocks in consensus
//! - Topology is finalized through consensus quorum
//!
//! **Verification**:
//! - Test: `test_block_validation_rejects_shard_topology_mismatches`
//! - Code: All consensus engines call `verify_block_shard_fields()`
//!
//! **Threat Model**:
//! - Byzantine proposer sending invalid topology: PBFT rejects
//! - Partition with different topology: Will fork on merge, detected
//! - Consensus leader deviating from topology: Slashed on detection
//!
//! ---
